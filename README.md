Introduction

Ames housing dataset contains information from the Ames Assessor√≠s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010. It consists of 2930 observations of residential homes, with 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables (and 2 additional observation identifiers) describing various attributes of the properties, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the size of the lot and garage. It presents a challenging regression problem due to a large number of features and the complex relationships between them.
